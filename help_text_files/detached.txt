Start app in detached mode (persistent session with temp log file)

This mode is particularly useful for coding agents that need to start
the app once and then continue to issue direct commands against the
detached app without restarts.

BEHAVIOR:
  - Starts the app as a background process
  - App persists after {{BIN_NAME}} command exits
  - Output redirected to temporary log file
  - Session survives terminal closure
  - Log files stored in: {{TEMP_DIR}}

USAGE:
  {{BIN_NAME}} -d                      # Start with auto-detected app (short form)
  {{BIN_NAME}} --detached              # Start with auto-detected app
  {{BIN_NAME}} -d --app ./game         # Start specific app with short form
  {{BIN_NAME}} --detached --app ./game # Start specific app
  {{BIN_NAME}} --info                  # Check session status
  {{BIN_NAME}} list                    # Issue direct mode commands to detached session
  {{BIN_NAME}} shutdown                # Stop detached session

APP DETECTION:
  When --app is not specified, {{BIN_NAME}} will auto-detect and use:
Use '{{BIN_NAME}} --detect' to see what app would be detected.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER MODES:
  direct:            {{BIN_NAME}} list                     (connect to running app)
  managed-commands:  {{BIN_NAME}} -m list                  (start, run, exit)
  detached:          {{BIN_NAME}} -d; {{BIN_NAME}} list    (start persistent, run commands)

  Direct mode does not distinguish between an app you started or one started with --detached.

NOTES:
  - Cannot be used with -m/--managed-commands
  - Cannot accept commands on same invocation
  - Use -c/--cleanup-logs to remove old log files
