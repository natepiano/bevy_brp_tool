COMMAND: shutdown (brp_tool/shutdown)
========================================

DESCRIPTION:
Gracefully shutdown the Bevy application

USAGE:
  {{BIN_NAME}} shutdown
  {{BIN_NAME}} --managed --commands 'shutdown'

BEHAVIOR:
1. Sends shutdown signal to the app
2. App performs cleanup operations
3. All pending operations are completed
4. Connection is closed
5. App process exits

RETURNS:
Confirmation message before connection closes

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
{"status": "Shutdown initiated"}

NOTES:
- Ensures clean shutdown with proper cleanup
- Waits for pending operations to complete
- Connection will be closed after response
- In managed mode, this ends the session
- Use at end of command sequences

EXAMPLES:
# Simple shutdown
$ {{BIN_NAME}} shutdown

# Take screenshot then shutdown
$ {{BIN_NAME}} --managed --commands 'screenshot /tmp/final.png,wait:1,shutdown'

# Complete workflow with shutdown
$ {{BIN_NAME}} --managed --commands 'ready,spawn {"bevy_core::name::Name": "Test"},wait:2,screenshot /tmp/test.png,wait:1,shutdown'

WORKFLOW TIPS:
- Always use shutdown at end of automated sequences
- Add wait after screenshots before shutdown
- Ensures all async operations complete
- Prevents orphaned processes in scripts
