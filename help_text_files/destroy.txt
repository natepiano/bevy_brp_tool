COMMAND: destroy (bevy/destroy)
========================================

DESCRIPTION:
Destroy an entity and all its components, removing it completely from the world

USAGE:
  {{BIN_NAME}} destroy <ENTITY_ID>
  {{BIN_NAME}} --managed --commands 'destroy <ENTITY_ID>'

ARGUMENTS:
  ENTITY_ID - The numeric ID of the entity to destroy

RETURNS:
Success confirmation or error message

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
{"status": "ok"}

EXAMPLES:
# Destroy entity 12345
$ {{BIN_NAME}} destroy 12345

# Destroy multiple entities in sequence
$ {{BIN_NAME}} --managed --commands 'destroy 12345; destroy 12346'

COMMON ERRORS:
❌ destroy 99999
   Error: Entity does not exist
✅ Verify entity exists with query or list_entities first

❌ destroy "entity_name"
   Error: Invalid entity ID format
✅ destroy 12345

NOTES:
- Destroying a parent entity also destroys all children recursively
- Entity ID must exist or command will error
- This operation cannot be undone
- All components are removed before entity destruction
- Child entities maintain their relative transforms when parent is destroyed

HIERARCHY BEHAVIOR:
When destroying a parent entity:
1. All child entities are also destroyed
2. The destruction is recursive (grandchildren, etc.)
3. No orphaned entities are left behind

Example hierarchy:
  Parent (12345)
    ├─ Child A (12346)
    │   └─ Grandchild (12348)
    └─ Child B (12347)

Destroying 12345 will also destroy 12346, 12347, and 12348

WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:
# Check entity hierarchy before destruction
$ {{BIN_NAME}} list_entity 12345
# See it has children: [12346, 12347]
$ {{BIN_NAME}} destroy 12345
# All entities (12345, 12346, 12347) are now destroyed

# Safer destruction pattern
$ {{BIN_NAME}} query bevy_core::name::Name
$ {{BIN_NAME}} get 4294967355 bevy_core::name::Name
# Verify this is the entity you want to destroy
$ {{BIN_NAME}} destroy 4294967355

COMPARISON WITH REMOVE:
- destroy: Removes entire entity and all components
- remove: Only removes specific component from entity
