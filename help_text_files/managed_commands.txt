Start app and execute commands directly (comma-separated)

SYNTAX:
  --managed-commands '<command1>,<command2>,<command3>'

EXAMPLES:
  --managed-commands 'list'
  --managed-commands 'ready,list,shutdown'
  --managed-commands 'spawn {"bevy_core::name::Name": "Test"}'
  --managed-commands 'wait:2,screenshot /tmp/test.png,shutdown'

APP DETECTION:
  When --app is not specified, {{BIN_NAME}} will auto-detect and use:
Use '{{BIN_NAME}} --detect' to see what app would be detected.

FEATURES:
  - Commands execute in sequence
  - App starts automatically and shuts down when done
  - Use wait:N to pause N seconds between commands
  - JSON commas inside {} are preserved
  - Both short (list) and full (bevy/list) command names work



NOTES:
  - Use --detached if you want to issue commands one at a time against a running app
  - Use --help-for <command> for detailed help on specific commands.
