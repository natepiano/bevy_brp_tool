  {{BIN_NAME}} --managed --commands 'list_entities'

Returns: JSON object with all entities and their components

Example output:
  {
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity": 4294967355,
        "generation": 1,
        "components": [
          "bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform",
          "bevy_transform::components::global_transform::GlobalTransform",
          "bevy_core::name::Name"
        ]
      },
      {
        "entity": 4294967356,
        "generation": 1,
        "components": [
          "bevy_render::camera::camera::Camera",
          "bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "total_count": 2
  }

NOTES:
  - Returns ALL entities in the world, not just those with specific components
  - Shows component type names, not component data
  - Entity IDs are u64 integers that you can use with other commands
  - Use this to discover what entities exist before querying their data
  - Much more comprehensive than 'query' which requires component filters

COMPARISON:
  list_entities - Shows ALL entities with their component lists
  query <component> - Shows entities that have specific component(s) with data
  list - Shows available component types (not entities)
